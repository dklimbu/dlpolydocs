  abstract = {Two-dimensional Raman and hybrid terahertz-Raman spectroscopic techniques provide invaluable insight into molecular structures and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, corroborating experimental results with theory is difficult due to the high computational cost of incorporating quantum-mechanical effects in the simulations. Here, we present the equilibrium--nonequilibrium ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a practical computational method that can account for nuclear quantum effects on the two-time response function of nonlinear optical spectroscopy. Unlike a recently developed approach based on the double Kubo transformed (DKT) correlation function, our method is exact in the classical limit, where it reduces to the established equilibrium-nonequilibrium classical molecular dynamics method. Using benchmark model calculations, we demonstrate the advantages of the equilibrium--nonequilibrium RPMD over classical and DKT-based approaches. Importantly, its derivation, which is based on the nonequilibrium RPMD, obviates the need for identifying an appropriate Kubo transformed correlation function and paves the way for applying real-time path-integral techniques to multidimensional spectroscopy.}

When the A--H distance is used as the reaction coordinate, the ring polymer trajectories are found to exhibit multiple recrossings of the transition state dividing surface and to give a rate coefficient that is smaller than the quantum transition state theory value by an order of magnitude. This is to be expected on kinematic grounds for a heavy-light-heavy reaction when the light atom transfer coordinate is used as the reaction coordinate, and it clearly precludes the use of transition state theory with this reaction coordinate. As has been shown previously for this problem, a solvent polarization coordinate defined in terms of the expectation value of the proton transfer distance in the ground adiabatic quantum state provides a better reaction coordinate with less recrossing. These results are discussed in light of the wide body...},

The solution of the problem is formulated by minimizing the sum of mass-weighted squared deviations (MWSD) of the nuclei of a displaced configuration from the nuclei of the equilibrium configuration. A mathematical proof of the equivalence of Eckart conditions and the minimum of MWSD is given. It is shown that the extrema of the sum of MWSD coincide with eigenvalues of a special 4 \texttimes{} 4 symmetric matrix. Its minimal eigenvalue corresponds to the desired solution, and the respective eigenvector can be treated as the quaternion containing the necessary information for rotating the original coordinate system and aligning its axes with the molecule-fixed coordinate system. A detailed scheme for an efficient numerical implementation of the method is provided, and a numerical example is given.},

Phys. 128:1321--1336, 2007), and which controls temperature by use of a device similar to that of Nos\'e dynamics, but adds random noise to improve ergodicity. In contrast to Langevin dynamics, where noise is added directly to each physical degree of freedom, the new scheme relies on an indirect coupling to a single Brownian particle. For a model with harmonic potentials, we show under a mild non-resonance assumption that we can recover the canonical distribution. In spite of its stochastic nature, experiments suggest that it introduces a relatively weak perturbative effect on the physical dynamics, as measured by perturbation of temporal autocorrelation functions. The kinetic energy is well controlled even in the early stages of a simulation.},

It was found that it can be eliminated in measurements with the Circle\textregistered{} multiple ATR cell by ensuring that the ATR rod is coaxial with the glass liquid holder. It was also found that normal laboratory temperature variations of a few degrees change the intensity by {$\leq$}\textasciitilde 1\% of the peak height. A new imaginary refractive index spectrum of water has been determined between 4000 and 700 cm-1 as the average of spectra calculated from ATR spectra recorded by four workers in our laboratory over the past seven years. It was obtained under experimental and computational conditions superior to those used previously, but is only marginally different from the spectra reported in 1989. In particular, the integrated intensities of the fundamentals are not changed significantly from those reported in 1989. The available imaginary refractive index, k, values between 15,000 and 1 cm-1 have been compared. The values that are judged to be the most reliable have been combined into a recommended k spectrum of H2O(l) at 25{$^\circ$}C between 15,000 and 1 cm-1, from which the real refractive index spectrum has been calculated by Kramers-Kronig transformation. The recommended values of the real and imaginary refractive indices and molar absorption coefficients of liquid water at 25 \textpm{} 1 {$^\circ$}C are presented in graphs and tables. The real and imaginary dielectric constants and the real and imaginary molar polarizabilities in this wavenumber range can be calculated from the tables. Conservatively estimated probable errors of the recommended k values are given. The precision with which the values can be measured in one laboratory and the relative errors between regions are, of course, far smaller than these probable errors. The recommended k values should be of considerable value as interim standard intensities of liquid water, which will facilitate the transfer of intensities between laboratories.},

  abstract = {A formalism is presented in this paper which, for the first time, establishes the theoretical basis for the quantum time evolution of path integral centroid variables and also provides clear motivation for using these variables to study condensed phase quantum dynamics. The equilibrium centroid distribution is first shown to be a well-defined distribution function which is specific to the canonical density operator. A quantum mechanical quasi-density operator (QDO) is associated with each value of the distribution so that, upon application of the standard quantum mechanical formalism, the QDO can be used to provide a rigorous definition of both static and dynamical centroid variables. Various properties of the dynamical centroid variables are derived, including the perspective that the centroid constraint on the imaginary time paths introduces a nonstationarity in the equilibrium ensemble which, in turn, can be shown to yield information on the correlations of spontaneous fluctuations. The analytic solution for the harmonic oscillator and a numerical solution for a double well system are provided which illustrate the various aspects of the theory. The theory contained herein provides the basis for a derivation of Centroid Molecular Dynamics, as well as the systematic improvements of that theory.}

We then calculate the outer sphere free energy barrier due to solvent reorganization from a PI molecular dynamics simulation and we obtain the dynamic transmission coefficient using ring polymer molecular dynamics. Combining these calculated values with literature values for the inner sphere reorganization energy, we obtain a reaction rate in good agreement with experimental measurements. The protocol introduced here circumvents the need for complex, system-specific force field parameterization along an assumed reaction coordinate making it sufficiently accurate, efficient, and broadly applicable to the study of both adiabatic and nonadiabatic charge transfer reactions in transition metal complexes.},

  abstract = {Nos\'e has derived a set of dynamical equations that can be shown to give canonically distributed positions and momenta provided the phase space average can be taken into the trajectory average, i.e., the system is ergodic [S. Nos\'e, J. Chem. Phys. 81, 511 (1984), W. G. Hoover, Phys. Rev. A 31, 1695 (1985)]. Unfortunately, the Nos\'e--Hoover dynamics is not ergodic for small or stiff systems. Here a modification of the dynamics is proposed which includes not a single thermostat variable but a chain of variables, Nos\'e--Hoover chains. The ``new'' dynamics gives the canonical distribution where the simple formalism fails. In addition, the new method is easier to use than an extension [D. Kusnezov, A. Bulgac, and W. Bauer, Ann. Phys. 204, 155 (1990)] which also gives the canonical distribution for stiff cases.}

  abstract = {We develop a path-integral dynamics method for water that resembles centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), except that the centroids are averages of curvilinear, rather than Cartesian, bead coordinates. The curvilinear coordinates are used explicitly only when computing the potential of mean force, the components of which are re-expressed in terms of Cartesian ``quasicentroids'' (so-called because they are close to the Cartesian centroids). Cartesian equations of motion are obtained by making small approximations to the quantum Boltzmann distribution. Simulations of the infrared spectra of various water models over 150--600 K show these approximations to be justified: for a two-dimensional OH-bond model, the quasicentroid molecular dynamics (QCMD) spectra lie close to the exact quantum spectra, and almost on top of the Matsubara dynamics spectra; for gas-phase water, the QCMD spectra are close to the exact quantum spectra; for liquid water and ice (using the q-TIP4P/F surface), the QCMD spectra are close to the CMD spectra at 600 K and line up with the results of thermostated ring-polymer molecular dynamics and approximate quantum calculations at 300 and 150 K. The QCMD spectra show no sign of the CMD ``curvature problem'' (of erroneous red shifts and broadening). In the liquid and ice simulations, the potential of mean force was evaluated on-the-fly by generalizing an adiabatic CMD algorithm to curvilinear coordinates; the full limit of adiabatic separation needed to be taken, which made the QCMD calculations 8 times more expensive than partially adiabatic CMD at 300 K, and 32 times at 150 K (and the intensities may still not be converged at this temperature). The QCMD method is probably generalizable to many other systems, provided that collective bead-coordinates can be identified that yield compact mean-field ring-polymer distributions.}

This correction is obtained by first calculating quasi-centroid radial and angular distribution functions in a short path integral molecular dynamics simulation and then using iterative Boltzmann inversion to obtain an effective classical potential that reproduces these distribution functions in a classical NVT simulation. We illustrate this approach with example applications to the vibrational spectra of gas phase molecules, obtaining excellent agreement with QCMD reference calculations for water and ammonia and good agreement with the quantum mechanical vibrational spectrum of methane.}

  abstract = {The development and implementation of increasingly accurate methods for electronic structure calculations mean that, for many atomistic simulation problems, treating light nuclei as classical particles is now one of the most serious approximations. Even though recent developments have significantly reduced the overhead for modeling the quantum nature of the nuclei, the cost is still prohibitive when combined with advanced electronic structure methods. Here we present how multiple time step integrators can be combined with ring-polymer contraction techniques (effectively, multiple time stepping in imaginary time) to reduce virtually to zero the overhead of modelling nuclear quantum effects, while describing inter-atomic forces at high levels of electronic structure theory. This is demonstrated for a combination of MP2 and semi-local DFT applied to the Zundel cation. The approach can be seamlessly combined with other methods to reduce the computational cost of path integral calculations, such as high-order factorizations of the Boltzmann operator or generalized Langevin equation thermostats.}

  abstract = {We use quantized molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the competition between concerted and sequential proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) reaction mechanisms in inorganic catalysts. By analyzing reactive nonadiabatic PCET trajectories and computing both concerted and sequential rate constants, we characterize various molecular features that govern inorganic PCET reactions, including the solvent polarity, ligand-mediated electron--proton interactions, and intrinsic proton-transfer (PT) energy barrier. Using atomistic simulations with over 1200 atoms, we find that the symmetric iron biimidazoline system is extremely biased toward the concerted mechanism because of the strong ligand-mediated electron--proton interaction and the short PT distance. However, by investigating system-bath models in which electron--proton interactions are shielded, which are representative of ruthenium terpyridylbenzoates and iron (tetraphenylporphyrin)benzoates, we predict that a crossover between the concerted and sequential PCET mechanisms may be possible either by increasing the polarity of the solvent or by increasing the intrinsic PT energy barrier. In addition, we predict the possibility of a crossover in the PCET mechanism by directly varying the strength of the ligand-mediated electron--proton interactions. The results presented here reveal new strategies for altering the competition between the competing PCET mechanisms and design principles for controlling PCET in catalytic systems.}

  abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.

Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the St\o rmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the LAMMPS code. References [1]S.

  abstract = {A fast centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) methodology is proposed in which the effective centroid forces are predetermined through a force-matching algorithm applied to a standard path integral molecular dynamics simulation. The resulting method greatly reduces the computational cost of generating centroid trajectories, thus extending the applicability of CMD. The method is applied to the study of liquid para-hydrogen at two state points and liquid ortho-deuterium at one state point. The static and dynamical results are compared to those obtained from full adiabatic CMD simulations and found to be in excellent agreement for all three systems; the transport properties are also compared to experiment and found to have a similar level of agreement.}

  abstract = {Centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) is a popular method to extract approximate quantum dynamics from path integral simulations. Very recently we have shown that CMD gas phase infrared spectra exhibit significant artificial redshifts of stretching peaks, due to the so-called ``curvature problem'' imprinted by the effective centroid potential. Here we provide evidence that for condensed phases, and in particular for liquid water, CMD produces pronounced artificial redshifts for high-frequency vibrations such as the OH stretching band. This peculiar behavior intrinsic to the CMD method explains part of the unexpectedly large quantum redshifts of the stretching band of liquid water compared to classical frequencies, which is improved after applying a simple and rough ``harmonic curvature correction.''}

  abstract = {Recent work shows that strong stability and dimensionality freedom are essential for robust numerical integration of thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (T-RPMD) and path-integral molecular dynamics, without which standard integrators exhibit non-ergodicity and other pathologies [R. Korol et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 124103 (2019) and R. Korol et al., J. Chem. Phys. 152, 104102 (2020)]. In particular, the BCOCB scheme, obtained via Cayley modification of the standard BAOAB scheme, features a simple reparametrization of the free ring-polymer sub-step that confers strong stability and dimensionality freedom and has been shown to yield excellent numerical accuracy in condensed-phase systems with large time steps. Here, we introduce a broader class of T-RPMD numerical integrators that exhibit strong stability and dimensionality freedom, irrespective of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck friction schedule. In addition to considering equilibrium accuracy and time step stability as in previous work, we evaluate the integrators on the basis of their rates of convergence to equilibrium and their efficiency at evaluating equilibrium expectation values. Within the generalized class, we find BCOCB to be superior with respect to accuracy and efficiency for various configuration-dependent observables, although other integrators within the generalized class perform better for velocity-dependent quantities. Extensive numerical evidence indicates that the stated performance guarantees hold for the strongly anharmonic case of liquid water. Both analytical and numerical results indicate that BCOCB excels over other known integrators in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and stability with respect to time step for practical applications.}

These potential functions reproduce the fluid structure accurately but at the present time do not reproduce thermodynamic information on the fluid, such as the internal energy or pressure. The method works in an iterative manner, starting from a reference fluid in which only Lennard-Jones interactions are included, and generates, by Monte Carlo simulation, successive corrections to those potentials which eventually lead to the correct site-site pair correlation functions. Using the approach the structure of water as determined from neuron scattering experiments is compared to the structure of water obtained from the simple point charge extended (SPCE) model of water interactions. The empirical potentials derived from both experiment and SPCE water show qualitative similarities with the true SPCE potential, although there are quantitative differences. The simulation is driven by a set of potential energy functions, with equilibration of the energy of the distribution, and not, as in the reverse Monte Carlo method, by equilibrating the value of {$\chi$}2, which measures how closely the simulated site-site pair correlation functions fit a set of diffraction data. As a result the simulation proceeds on a true random walk and samples a wide range of possible molecular configurations.}

  abstract = {We further develop the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method for calculating chemical reaction rates [I. R. Craig and D. E. Manolopoulos, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 084106 (2005)]. We begin by showing how the rate coefficient we obtained before can be calculated in a more efficient way by considering the side functions of the ring-polymer centroids, rather than averaging over the side functions of the individual ring-polymer beads. This has two distinct advantages. First, the statistics of the phase-space average over the ring-polymer coordinates and momenta are greatly improved. Second, the resulting flux-side correlation function converges to its long-time limit much more rapidly. Indeed the short-time limit of this flux-side correlation function already provides a "quantum transition state theory" approximation to the final rate coefficient. In cases where transition state recrossing effects are negligible, and the transition state dividing surface is put in the right place, the RPMD rate is therefore obtained almost instantly. We then go on to show that the long-time limit of the new flux-side correlation function, and hence the fully converged RPMD reaction rate, is rigorously independent of the choice of the transition state dividing surface. This is especially significant because the optimum dividing surface can often be very difficult to determine for reactions in complex chemical systems.}

  abstract = {A quantum simulation of an imaginary time path integral typically requires around n times more computational effort than the corresponding classical simulation, where n is the number of ring polymer beads (or imaginary time slices) used in the calculation. However, this estimate neglects the fact that the potential energies of many systems can be decomposed into a sum of rapidly varying short-range and slowly varying long-range contributions. For such systems, the computational effort of the path integral simulation can be reduced considerably by evaluating the long-range forces on a contracted ring polymer with fewer beads than are needed to evaluate the short-range forces. This idea is developed and then illustrated with an application to a flexible model of liquid water in which the intramolecular forces are evaluated with 32 beads, the oxygen-oxygen Lennard-Jones forces with seven, and the intermolecular electrostatic forces with just five. The resulting static and dynamic properties are within a few percent of those of a full 32-bead calculation, and yet they are obtained with a computational effort less than six times (rather than 32 times) that of a classical simulation. We hope that this development will encourage future studies of quantum mechanical fluctuations in liquid water and aqueous solutions and in many other systems with similar interaction potentials.}

  abstract = {Two of the most successful methods that are presently available for simulating the quantum dynamics of condensed phase systems are centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD). Despite their conceptual differences, practical implementations of these methods differ in just two respects: the choice of the Parrinello-Rahman mass matrix and whether or not a thermostat is applied to the internal modes of the ring polymer during the dynamics. Here, we explore a method which is halfway between the two approximations: we keep the path integral bead masses equal to the physical particle masses but attach a Langevin thermostat to the internal modes of the ring polymer during the dynamics. We justify this by showing analytically that the inclusion of an internal mode thermostat does not affect any of the established features of RPMD: thermostatted RPMD is equally valid with respect to everything that has actually been proven about the method as RPMD itself. In particular, because of the choice of bead masses, the resulting method is still optimum in the short-time limit, and the transition state approximation to its reaction rate theory remains closely related to the semiclassical instanton approximation in the deep quantum tunneling regime. In effect, there is a continuous family of methods with these properties, parameterised by the strength of the Langevin friction. Here, we explore numerically how the approximation to quantum dynamics depends on this friction, with a particular emphasis on vibrational spectroscopy. We find that a broad range of frictions approaching optimal damping give similar results, and that these results are immune to both the resonance problem of RPMD and the curvature problem of CMD.}

  abstract = {The coupled cluster (CC) ansatz is generally recognized as providing one of the best wave function-based descriptions of electronic correlation in small- and medium-sized molecules. The fact that the CC equations with double excitations (CCD) may be expressed as a handful of dense matrix-matrix multiplications makes it an ideal method to be ported to graphics processing units (GPUs). We present our implementation of the spin-free CCD equations in which the entire iterative procedure is evaluated on the GPU. The GPU-accelerated algorithm readily achieves a factor of 4-5 speedup relative to the multithreaded CPU algorithm on same-generation hardware. The GPU-accelerated algorithm is approximately 8-12 times faster than Molpro, 17-22 times faster than NWChem, and 21-29 times faster than GAMESS for each CC iteration. Single-precision GPU-accelerated computations are also performed, leading to an additional doubling of performance. Single-precision errors in the energy are typically on the order of 10-6 hartrees and can be improved by about an order of magnitude by performing one additional iteration in double precision.}

Both methods can be used to compute quasiclassical time correlation functions which have direct application in molecular spectroscopy; in particular, to infrared spectroscopy via dipole autocorrelation functions. The performance of both methods for computing vibrational spectra of several simple but representative molecular model systems is investigated systematically as a function of temperature and isotopic substitution. In this context both CMD and RPMD feature intrinsic problems which are quantified and investigated in detail.

  abstract = {The development of effective centroid potentials (ECPs) is explored with both the constrained-centroid and quasi-adiabatic force matching using liquid water as a test system. A trajectory integrated with the ECP is free of statistical noises that would be introduced when the centroid potential is approximated on the fly with a finite number of beads. With the reduced cost of ECP, challenging experimental properties can be studied in the spirit of centroid molecular dynamics. The experimental number density of H2O is 0.38\% higher than that of D2O. With the ECP, the H2O number density is predicted to be 0.42\% higher, when the dispersion term is not refit. After correction of finite size effects, the diffusion constant of H2O is found to be 21\% higher than that of D2O, which is in good agreement with the 29.9\% higher diffusivity for H2O observed experimentally. Although the ECP is also able to capture the redshifts of both the OH and OD stretching modes in liquid water, there are a number of properties that a classical simulation with the ECP will not be able to recover. For example, the heat capacities of H2O and D2O are predicted to be almost identical and higher than the experimental values. Such a failure is simply a result of not properly treating quantized vibrational energy levels when the trajectory is propagated with classical mechanics. Several limitations of the ECP based approach without bead population reconstruction are discussed.}

In this work, by simulating the infrared spectrum of gas-phase ammonia, we test the feasibility of extending QCMD beyond water. Overall, QCMD works as well for ammonia as for water, reducing or eliminating blue shifts from the classical spectrum without introducing the artificial red shifts or broadening associated with other imaginary-time path-integral methods. However, QCMD gives only a modest improvement over the classical spectrum for the position of the symmetric bend mode, which is highly anharmonic (since it correlates with the inversion pathway). We expect QCMD to have similar problems with large-amplitude degrees of freedom in other molecules but otherwise to work as well as for water.}

  abstract = {Including quantum mechanical effects on the dynamics of nuclei in the condensed phase is challenging, because the complexity of exact methods grows exponentially with the number of quantum degrees of freedom. Efforts to circumvent these limitations can be traced down to two approaches: methods that treat a small subset of the degrees of freedom with rigorous quantum mechanics, considering the rest of the system as a static or classical environment, and methods that treat the whole system quantum mechanically, but using approximate dynamics. Here, we perform a systematic comparison between these two philosophies for the description of quantum effects in vibrational spectroscopy, taking the Embedded Local Monomer model and a mixed quantum-classical model as representatives of the first family of methods, and centroid molecular dynamics and thermostatted ring polymer molecular dynamics as examples of the latter. We use as benchmarks D2O doped with HOD and pure H2O at three distinct thermodynamic state points (ice Ih at 150 K, and the liquid at 300 K and 600 K), modeled with the simple q-TIP4P/F potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. With few exceptions the different techniques yield IR absorption frequencies that are consistent with one another within a few tens of cm-1. Comparison with classical molecular dynamics demonstrates the importance of nuclear quantum effects up to the highest temperature, and a detailed discussion of the discrepancies between the various methods let us draw some (circumstantial) conclusions about the impact of the very different approximations that underlie them. Such cross validation between radically different approaches could indicate a way forward to further improve the state of the art in simulations of condensed-phase quantum dynamics.}

We also modify the mass-scaling used in the adiabatic QCMD algorithm, which allows the molecular dynamics timestep to be quadrupled, thus reducing the expense of a QCMD calculation to twice that of Cartesian centroid molecular dynamics for qTIP4P/F liquid water at 300~K, and eight times for ice at 150~K.}

The corrections are found by using a regularized iterative Boltzmann inversion procedure to recover the inter- and intramolecular quasi-centroid distribution functions obtained from a path integral molecular dynamics simulation. The resulting methodology is found to give good agreement with a previously published QCMD dipole absorption spectrum for liquid water and satisfactory agreement for ice. It also gives good agreement with spectra from a recent implementation of CMD that uses a precomputed elevated temperature potential of mean force. Modern centroid molecular dynamics methods, therefore, appear to be reaching a consensus regarding the impact of nuclear quantum effects on the vibrational spectra of water and ice.}

However, calculation of the centroid effective force remains a significant computational cost and limits the ability of CMD to be an efficient approach to study condensed phase quantum dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a neural network-based methodology for first learning the centroid effective force from path integral molecular dynamics data, which is subsequently used as an effective force field to evolve the centroids directly with the CMD algorithm. This method, called machine-learned centroid molecular dynamics (ML-CMD), is faster and far less costly than both standard ``on the fly'' CMD and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD). The training aspect of ML-CMD is also straightforwardly implemented utilizing the DeepMD software kit. ML-CMD is then applied to two model systems to illustrate the approach: liquid para-hydrogen and water. The results show comparable accuracy to both CMD and RPMD in the estimation of quantum dynamical properties, including the self-diffusion constant and velocity time correlation function, but with significantly reduced overall computational cost.}

  abstract = {Even though the computation of local properties, such as densities or radial distribution functions, remains one of the most standard goals of molecular simulation, it still largely relies on straightforward histogram-based strategies. Here, we highlight recent developments of alternative approaches leading, from different perspectives, to estimators with a reduced variance compared to conventional binning. They all make use of the force acting on the particles, in addition to their position, and allow us to focus on the non-trivial part of the problem in order to alleviate (or even remove in some cases) the catastrophic behavior of histograms as the bin size decreases. The corresponding computational cost is negligible for molecular dynamics simulations, since the forces are already computed to generate the configurations, and the benefit of reduced-variance estimators is even larger when the cost of generating the latter is high, in particular, with ab initio simulations. The force sampling approach may result in spurious residual non-zero values of the density in regions where no particles are present, but strategies are available to mitigate this artifact. We illustrate this approach on number, charge, and polarization densities, radial distribution functions, and local transport coefficients, discuss the connections between the various perspectives, and suggest future challenges for this promising approach.}

  abstract = {The potential of supercomputers for MD simulation runs is explored for the CYBER 205 vectorcomputer in the treatment of molecular liquids with site-site interaction potentials. Careful vectorization and optimization of remaining scalar codes is shown to reduce the CPU time to 7\% as compared to the original code. The advantage of avoiding IO completely by computing time correlation functions in the course of the MD run is demostrated. Special emphasis is given to optimized data structures and data flow in order to minimize start up times and to exploit the hardware features of the CYBER 205.}

  abstract = {The path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method provides a convenient way to compute the quantum mechanical structural and thermodynamic properties of condensed phase systems at the expense of introducing an additional set of high frequency normal modes on top of the physical vibrations of the system. Efficiently sampling such a wide range of frequencies provides a considerable thermostatting challenge. Here we introduce a simple stochastic path integral Langevin equation (PILE) thermostat which exploits an analytic knowledge of the free path integral normal mode frequencies. We also apply a recently developed colored noise thermostat based on a generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which automatically achieves a similar, frequency-optimized sampling. The sampling efficiencies of these thermostats are compared with that of the more conventional Nos\'e--Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat for a number of physically relevant properties of the liquid water and hydrogen-in-palladium systems. In nearly every case, th...},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of a recently introduced approach to account for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) in molecular simulations: the adaptive quantum thermal bath (adQTB). In this method, zero-point energy is introduced through a generalized Langevin thermostat designed to precisely enforce the quantum fluctuation--dissipation theorem. We propose a refined adQTB algorithm with improved accuracy and report adQTB simulations of liquid water. Through extensive comparison with reference path integral calculations, we demonstrate that it provides excellent accuracy for a broad range of structural and thermodynamic observables as well as infrared vibrational spectra. The adQTB has a computational cost comparable to that of classical molecular dynamics, enabling simulations of up to millions of degrees of freedom.}
